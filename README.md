CZ3005: Artificial Intelligence								           Feb 2022 – Apr 2022
•	Lab 1: Implemented the Breadth-first search and A star algorithm to find the shortest path from a source to a destination with constraints of cost given a graph with nodes and edges, each edge has a cost and a distance. Used: Python
•	Lab 2: Built the Wumpus World game with a driver and an agent. The agent uses knowledge that it gains from sensing around and infers the next instruction for the driver to collect all coins on the map. Used: Prolog, Python.
